## Usage Flow

### Getting Started

1. **Start Bot**: `/start`
2. **Connect Wallet**: `/connect` and provide private key
3. **Claim PYUSD**: `/claimfaucet` to get test tokens
4. **Deposit**: `/deposit 100` to deposit to executor
5. **Follow Broadcaster**: `/subscribe 0xc8bc...`

### Trading Flow

1. **Check Broadcasters**: `/broadcasters`
2. **Follow**: `/subscribe <address>`
3. **Monitor**: `/portfolio` and `/balance`
4. When broadcaster posts signal, trades execute automatically!
5. **Withdraw**: `/withdraw <amount>` anytime

## How Copy Trading Works

1. You deposit PYUSD to the executor contract
2. You follow broadcasters you trust
3. When a broadcaster posts a signal, the relayer executes it
4. All followers get the same fair price (via batch execution)
5. You pay the broadcaster's fee (10-20%) on profits
6. You can withdraw anytime
